JShell: 
JShell is an interactive command-line tool. It is part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) and serves as Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment for the Java programming language.

JVM:
Java virtual machine which enables the execution of Java bytecode.
Java compiler converts Java source code into bytecode, JVM then takes this bytecode and interprets it, translating it into machine code which OS can understand.

JRE: Java Runtime Environment
JRE creates a runtime environment in which the program can run effectively. It provides the necessary components to run Java applications. It includes the JVM, class libraries
and other supporting files.

JDK: Java Development Kit
JDK is a software development environment used for creating Java applications. It includes tools and libraries necessary for compiling, debugging, and running Java code.

Which file will run:
One file will run which contains the main method with specific signature --> public static void main()
Java is object oriented, means everything is written in objects, for objects we need classes.
After running the file, a new file will be generated with name = <filename>.class ---> contains bytecode

Steps to run a java file:
1. compile it -> javac <filename>.java 
   like javac myfile.java
2. run file -> java myfile

Print some thing: 
System.out.print() --> no new line 
System.out.println() --> out put will be in new line

Data Types:
1. Primituve -- built in
   Integer, float, charcater, boolean

2. User defined

Memory: Stack and Heap
both stack and heap are created by JVM and are stored in RAM. Heap has more memory than stack.

Stack:
-- stores variables on temorary basis.
-- has separate memory block for methods.
-- store primitive data types like char, int, bool.
-- store references for the objects in the heap. [*** when object is created using new keyword, it is stored in the heap memory, but its reference is stored in stack***]
-- reference are of 3 types : strong, weak, soft
-- there are multiple stacks as each thread has its own stack memory but thread share common heap memory [*** reference from Operating system concept***]

Heap:
-- when the things stored in stack are no longer useful for us like variables or function call or objects, their reference are removed from the stack, but the object which
are already declared will remain in the heap memory.
-- removal of these is done by [***Garbage Collector***]

-- for this , there is a command : system.gc(), but there is no gurantee that garbage collector will run, so it is called automatic memory management.

Array:
-- int x[] = {1, 2, 3} ,    int x[] = new int[4] ,      jagged array : in which number of columns are not specified.

String: [ String x = "Jatin" ]
it is object in java. so when we create a string, it will be stored in heap memory. In heap , it is stored in special are calles string pool. 

StringBuffer: [ StringBuufer sb = new String Buffer() ]
StringBuffer is a class that represents a mutable sequence of characters. StringBuffer allows for dynamic changing to its content without creating new objects for each
change. This makes it more efficient for operations involving frequent string manipulations, such as appending, inserting, deleting, or replacing characters within a string. 

-- operations like append(), insert(), delete(), and replace()
-- by default , provides the space of 16 bytes.
-- it uses continous memory allocation.

Static kewword:
-- static variable is shared by all the objects.
-- static variables can be called directly with class name, without creating new objects.

-- consider the code:

class phone {
  String name;
  int price;

  public phone() ---> constuctor
  { price = 100}

  static -->> static block
  {name = "samsung"}

  // other functions or varibles blocks below
}

in the above code, constructor will be called whenever the object was created, but static block will be eecuted only single time
because when we are working with class and objects, there are 2 things
1. class loads   2. objects are instantiated

-- class will load only once, there is a special area in JVM , which is class loader, which contains all classes which are loaded.
-- our classes will be loaded from our library to the class loader and it happen only once.


if we dont create objects above things will not happen, but still if we want to do this , there is a class in java 

[ *** Class.forName(className: "phone") *** ]--> phone class will be loaded to class loader.

Super:
-- used to call constructor of super class 
-- we can also pass paramete to super() like super(n).

this():
this() is used to run the default constuctor when there are multiple constructor in the class 

for example , there are 2 constuctor = non parametrased (let say it is default one) and parameterised, so on using this() , default one will be executed.

Anonymous object:
-- delcared like : new A() -->> cannot be reused
